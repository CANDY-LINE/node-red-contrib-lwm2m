Node-RED node for OMA LwM2M Client using Eclipse Wakaama
===

This node internally spawns a `lwm2mclient` process and starts inter-process communication (IPC) over stdin and stdout. The `lwm2mclient` executable is slightly different from Wakaama's implementation, some of management objects are stripped and replaced with Node.js implementation.

When the parent process (i.e. Node-RED) exits, this node tries to emit a De-registration message to LwM2M server so that the server knows the client is gone.

This node restarts a new process when the child process is exited after a given interval time passes.

CoAP over DTLS is supported but disabled by default. Users are able to enable DTLS if necessary. However, supported security mechanism is only pre-shared key. RPK and X.509 are not supported.

The inter-process communication over stdin/stdio is NOT encrypted. `ps` command allows you to show entire command line to start `lwm2mclient` including PSK Identity and PSK information.

# Features

## Installed Nodes

- `lwm2m client` ... a LwM2M client configuration node, having LwM2M server host, port and other connection settings as well as custom management objects
- `lwm2m client in` ... a Node-RED node emitting LwM2M server events and/or internal object query results
- `lwm2m client out` ... a Node-RED node accepting a Write/Execute operation message from the input port

All errors are propagated to Catch-all node.

The input and output nodes show the following connection status.

- bootstrap required
- bootstrapping
- register required
- registering
- connected
- disconnected
- error
- timeout

## Supported LwM2M operations

- `read`
- `write`
- `execute`
- `observe`
- `discover`
- ~~`create`~~ (TBD)
- ~~`delete`~~ (TBD)

† ACL Object management will be implemented on `create` and `delete` operation support

† Bootstrap is not yet tested

## Predefined Objects

The following objects are implemented in C (Using Wakaama example).

- `Security Object`
- `Server Object`

## Bundled Objects

The following objects are implemented in Javascript. They can be overlaid with user defined object JSON (see below).

- `Access Control Object`
- `Device Object`

Security Notice) The project depends on [`systeminformation`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/systeminformation) package to collect system information. This package is excellent but it can expose sensitive information like serial number, device model and OS version to a LwM2M server. In order to avoid unexpected exposure to a public sandbox server, `Hide Sensitive Device Info` property is enabled by default. So you need to uncheck it prior to sending entire device information from the node.

## User's Custom Objects and Object Overlay

This node allows you to create new objects and overlay bundled objects (not predefined objects).

With the powerful Node-RED JSON editor, you can easily manipulate your own management objects.

### Management Object JSON format

```
{
    "0": {                         => Object ID (M)
        "0": {                     => Instance ID (M)
            "0": {                 => Resource ID (M)
                "type": "...",     => Resource Type (see below) (M)
                "acl": "...",      => Resource ACL (see below) (O)
                "sensitive": true, => true if the value is sensitive (O)
                "value": "..."     => Resource Value (O)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Resource Types

Supported resource types are as follows:

- `STRING` ... String
- `OPAQUE` ... Byte Array
- `INTEGER` ... 64bit integer
- `FLOAT` ... double
- `BOOLEAN` ... boolean
- `OBJECT_LINK` ... Object Link
- `MULTIPLE_RESOURCE` ... Resource Array
- `FUNCTION` ... This is NOT a LwM2M Resource Type. Used for defining `execute` operation Resource

#### Resource Type JSON format

##### `STRING`

```
{
    "type": "STRING",
    "value": "Lorem ipsum"
}
```

or

```
"Lorem ipsum"
```

##### `OPAQUE`

```
{
    "type": "OPAQUE",
    "value": "Lorem ipsum"
}
```

or

```
{
    "type": "OPAQUE",
    "value": "base64:TG9yZW0gaXBzdW0="
}
```

or

```
{
    "type": "OPAQUE",
    "value": "hex:4c6f72656d20697073756d"
}
```

or

```
{
    "type": "OPAQUE",
    "value": [76,111,114,101,109,32,105,112,115,117,109]
}
```

or

```
{
    "type": "OPAQUE",
    "value": {
        "type": "Buffer",
        "data": [76,111,114,101,109,32,105,112,115,117,109]
    }

    "value": 1234567890
}
```

or

```
1234567890
```

##### `FLOAT`

```

##### `BOOLEAN`

```
{
    "type": "BOOLEAN",
    "value": false
}
```

or

```
true
```

##### `OBJECT_LINK`

    "value": {
        "objectId": 999,
        "objectInstanceId": 0

##### `FUNCTION`

This type is out of OMA LwM2M specification scope. Used for defining an executable resource data. `value` property is always ignored and `acl` is always assumed as `E`(other values are silently ignored).

```
{
    "type": "FUNCTION"
}
```

#### ACL

ACL characters and allowed operations are shown below.

- `R` ... Read, Observe, Discover, Write-Attributes
- `W` ... Write
- `E` ... Execute
- `D` ... Delete
- `C` ... Create
