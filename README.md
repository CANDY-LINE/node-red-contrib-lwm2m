Node-RED node for OMA LwM2M
===

[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/CANDY-LINE/node-red-contrib-lwm2m.svg)](https://github.com/CANDY-LINE/node-red-contrib-lwm2m/releases/latest)
[![master Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CANDY-LINE/node-red-contrib-lwm2m.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CANDY-LINE/node-red-contrib-lwm2m/)
[![License MIT](https://img.shields.io/github/license/CANDY-LINE/node-red-contrib-lwm2m.svg)](http://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)

This node offers OMA LwM2M client functionalities and allows you to create your own OMA LwM2M client applications on top of Node-RED.

This node internally spawns a [`wakatiwaiclient`](https://github.com/CANDY-LINE/wakatiwai) process, which is a revised version of [Eclipse Wakaama](https://github.com/eclipse/wakaama) executable, and starts inter-process communication (IPC) over stdin and stdout. The [`wakatiwaiclient`](https://github.com/CANDY-LINE/wakatiwai) executable is slightly different from [Wakaama](https://github.com/eclipse/wakaama)'s implementation, some of management objects are stripped. This node allows you to describe your own management objects as well.

When the parent process (i.e. Node-RED) exits, this node tries to emit a De-registration message to LwM2M server so that the server knows the client is gone.

This node restarts a new process when the child process exits after a given interval time passes.

CoAP over DTLS is supported but disabled by default. Users are able to enable DTLS if necessary. However, supported security mechanism is only pre-shared key(PSK). RPK and X.509 are not supported.

The supported message format is `TLV` rather than ~~`JSON`~~.

**Security Notice:**

Keep in mind that the inter-process communication over stdin/stdio is **NOT** encrypted and does **NOT** have any authentication mechanism. `ps` command allows users to show entire command line to start [`wakatiwaiclient`](https://github.com/CANDY-LINE/wakatiwai) including PSK Identity and PSK information.

# Features

## Installed Nodes

- `lwm2m client` ... a LwM2M client configuration node, having LwM2M server host, port and other connection settings as well as custom management objects
- `lwm2m client in` ... a Node-RED node emitting LwM2M server events and/or internal object query results
- `lwm2m client out` ... a Node-RED node accepting a Write/Execute operation message from the input port

All errors are propagated to Catch-all node.

The input and output nodes show the following connection status.

- bootstrap required
- bootstrapping
- register required
- registering
- connected
- disconnected
- error
- timeout
- *subscribed* - only for `lwm2m client in` node with `Subscribe LwM2M Object Events` checked

## Supported LwM2M operations

- `read`
- `write`
- `execute`
- `observe`
- `discover`
- `create`
- `delete`

## Bundled Objects

The following objects are implemented in Javascript. They can be overlaid with user defined object JSON (see below).

- `Security Object`
- `Server Object`
- `Access Control Object`
- `Device Object`

Security Notice) The project depends on [`systeminformation`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/systeminformation) package to collect system information. This package is excellent but it can expose sensitive information like serial number, device model and OS version to a LwM2M server. In order to avoid unexpected exposure to a public sandbox server, `Hide sensitive device info.` property is checked by default. So you need to uncheck it prior to sending entire device information from the node.

## User's Custom Objects and Object Overlay

This node allows you to create new objects and overlay bundled objects (not predefined objects).

With the powerful Node-RED JSON editor, you can easily manipulate your own management objects.

### Management Object JSON format

â€  Not compatible with LwM2M JSON data format

```
{
    "0": {                         => Object ID (M)
        "0": {                     => Instance ID (M)
            "0": {                 => Resource ID (M)
                "type": "...",     => Resource Type (see below) (M)
                "acl": "...",      => Resource ACL (see below) (O)
                "sensitive": true, => true if the value is sensitive (O)
                "value": "..."     => Resource Value (O)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Resource Types

Supported resource types are as follows:

- `STRING` ... String
- `OPAQUE` ... Buffer (byte array)
- `INTEGER` ... 64bit integer
- `FLOAT` ... double
- `BOOLEAN` ... boolean (`STRING` value `1`, `INTEGER` value `1`, and `OPAQUE` 1st byte `1` are all translated into `true`)
- `OBJECT_LINK` ... Object Link
- `MULTIPLE_RESOURCE` ... Resource Array
- `FUNCTION` ... This is **NOT** a LwM2M Resource Type. Used for defining `execute` operation Resource

#### Resource Type JSON format

##### `STRING`

```
{
    "type": "STRING",
    "value": "Lorem ipsum"
}
```

or

```
"Lorem ipsum"
```

##### `OPAQUE`

```
{
    "type": "OPAQUE",
    "value": "Lorem ipsum"
}
```

or

```
{
    "type": "OPAQUE",
    "value": "base64:TG9yZW0gaXBzdW0="
}
```

or

```
{
    "type": "OPAQUE",
    "value": "hex:4c6f72656d20697073756d"
}
```

or

```
{
    "type": "OPAQUE",
    "value": [76,111,114,101,109,32,105,112,115,117,109]
}
```

or

```
{
    "type": "OPAQUE",
    "value": {
        "type": "Buffer",
        "data": [76,111,114,101,109,32,105,112,115,117,109]
    }
}
```

```
{
    "type": "FLOAT",
    "value": 987654.321
}
```

or

```
987654.321

    "value": {
        "objectId": 999,
        "objectInstanceId": 0
    }
}
```

##### `FUNCTION`

This type is out of OMA LwM2M specification scope. Used for defining an executable resource data. `value` property is always ignored and `acl` is always assumed as `E`(other values are silently ignored).

```
{
    "type": "FUNCTION"
}
```

#### ACL

ACL characters and allowed operations are shown below.

- `R` ... Read, Observe, Discover, Write-Attributes
- `W` ... Write
- `E` ... Execute
- `D` ... Delete
- `C` ... Create

## Global predefined objects

You can add your own systemwide custom objects by describing them in your `settings.js` or `RED.settings` objects.

Here's an example for providing the predefined manufacturer name.

`settings.js`
```
{
    lwm2m: {
        objects : {
            '3': {
                '0': {
                    '0': 'ACME Corporation'
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Debug output

You can enable `Observe`, `Read` and `Write` command debug log (stdout or `/var/log/syslog`) by setting logging level to `debug` at `logging.console.logging` in `settings.js`. For CANDY RED users, modify `CANDY_RED_LOG_LEVEL` in `$(npm -g root)/services/systemd/environment` file.

The example output is shown below.

```

```

## LwM2M Message Dump

With a new option `Dump LwM2M messages`, message hex dump is now available.
All messages between client and server are displayed in console (not the debug tab) as shown below when `Dump LwM2M messages` is checked.

```
Sending 51 bytes to [127.0.0.1]:5684

## Embedded Mode Extensions

This node offers extra features for [embedded](https://nodered.org/docs/embedding) mode, which allows the host application to interact with this node via `EventEmitter` object named `internalEventBus` defined in `RED.settings` object.

However, this feature is **disabled** by default (opt-in). In order to enable it, ask users to check `Allow internal event propagation` property in `lwm2m` config node.

**Pseudo code:**

```
const EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter;
const RED = ...;
const server = ...;

const bus = new EventEmitter();
bus.on('object-event', (ev) => {
    // You can receive LwM2M object events here
    if (ev.eventType === 'updated') {
        ...
    }
});
// Create the settings object - see default settings.js file for other options
const settings = {
    ...
    lwm2m: {
        internalEventBus: bus, // set your own EventEmitter object
        objects : {
            '3': {
                '0': {
                    '0': "ACME Corporation"
                }
            },
            '99999': {
                '0': {
                    '0': 'ABCD'
                }
            }
        }
    },
    ...
};

RED.init(server, settings);
...

bus.emit('object-read', { id: '022eb56240784b43', topic: '/3/0/0' }); // 'Read' operation for retrieving Manufacturer
// Use a one-time listener (once)
bus.once('object-read-022eb56240784b43', (msg) => {
    if (/* boolean */ msg.error) {
        console.error(msg.payload); // error info
    } else {
        let man = msg.payload['/3/0/0'];
        ...
    }
});
// Same as above with a permanent listener
bus.on('object-result', (msg) => {
    if (msg.id === '022eb56240784b43') {
        if (/* boolean */ msg.error) {
            console.error(msg.payload); // error info
        } else {
            let man = msg.payload['/3/0/0'];
            ...
        }
    }
});
```
